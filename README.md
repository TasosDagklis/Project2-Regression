# Project2-Regression
Linear regression with shallow neural networks
In this project I created small neural networks for regression. The data I used are
the monthly variation of the average global temperature as a function of the concentration of a series of gases
in the atmosphere, the density of suspended particles, and additional indicators of phenomena such as solar
radiation and El Nino drift.
